# Testing

# Challenges

Git 
- Wasn't familiar with Git, didn't know what and how to use source control and how to commit at first, but after reaching out to the Slack community, I've come to understand it and how it works.
- After my first initial deployment, the site link wasn't working responsibly. After refreshing several times, link was deployed successfully

Footer 
- Sectioning my footer into 3 sections at the start was difficult as I couldn't understand CSS/BS Grid. I decided to reach out to the slack community and throughly watch video tutoriols on CSS grid. After having a play around, I managed to understand it and intergrate it in my site
- The social icons weren't appearing as it was within a div. Removed my div and solved the problem 

CSS/Bootstrap
- The table on index page wasn't responsive due to added padding. I removed the padding which solved the problem, the table is now responsive

# Bugs

- My images weren't being displyed in my README. I needed to add a correct typo in my [] to solve this problem

# Deployment

- This repo was deployed through GitHub pages. I did this by:

1. Logged on to github and opened my repository Log in GitHub and open the repository
2. From here clicked settings, see picture below.
